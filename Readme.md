## Overview
This is an implementation of  the paper :**The paper from Shenzhen University,it will be public when accepted**

## Required packages:
+ python 3+
+ sklearn 0.20.3+


## Data
+ data/dataset-1
+ data/video-1
+ data/video-2

## usage

+ feature-extraction.py

    It will produce the csv file include all fetures

+ Anomaly-detection.py

    You can select different anomaly detection and feature groups.
    The result of all feature group and anomaly detection alogrithm will be produced for default.
## Result
Detail in experiment-1 fold.

## Note

+ *Due to the randomness and probability value results of the initial value of the anomaly detection algorithm. The results of each run will be slightly different on probability values. But this does not affect the overall evaluation of the results of the algorithm.*


+ *If you don't want to copy and move image file accordding to the classificaiton,please comment the mv_result() function.comment for default.Otherwise it will take up a lot of storage space*
